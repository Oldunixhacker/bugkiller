<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
<p><strong>These instructions are for Linux systems. If you use Windows,
good luck finding out how to install Bugkiller.</strong></p>
<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>
<h3 id="hard">Hard</h3>
<p>Without these, Bugkiller won’t work.</p>
<ul>
<li>A properly configured Apache2 server</li>
<li>PHP and its module for Apache, else you’ll see a plain text copy of
the Bugkiller scripts</li>
<li>MySQL or compatible, e.g. MariaDB or Percona Server <sup>(there are
plans to support other database software in the future)</sup></li>
<li>Git, for software download and updates</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="soft">Soft</h3>
<p>These are some extras to make Bugkiller more powerful or secure.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RECOMMENDED: An Apache configuration to block access to
<code>config.ini</code> in your Bugkiller root directory, else your
database password will be leaked and your server will be
vulnerable!</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="install">Install</h2>
<p><strong>Remember to become root using <code>sudo -i</code>,
<code>sudo bash</code>, <code>sudo su</code>, or similar, as
<code>/var/www</code> is only writable by the root and Apache
users.</strong></p>
<h3 id="download">Download</h3>
<p>cd into your Apache content directory:</p>
<pre><code>cd /var/www
ls
cd html # replace html with the name of the folder, if it isn&#39;t html</code></pre>
<p>Then, clone the Bugkiller repository:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/TylerMS887/bugkiller --branch bugkiller-install/stable</code></pre>
<p>Bugkiller will now be served at <code>/bugkiller</code> on your
website.<br />
You can move the folder’s contents to change where Bugkiller is, but it
should be kept intact if you are going to set up fancy URLs (e.g.
<code>bk/reportbug</code> instead of
<code>bugkiller/reportbug.php</code>) after installation.</p>
<h3 id="setup-sql">Setup SQL</h3>
<p>Enter your SQL console, and run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>CREATE DATABASE bugkiller;
CREATE USER &#39;bugkilleruser&#39;@&#39;localhost&#39; IDENTIFIED BY &#39;my_awesome_password&#39;;
GRANT ALL ON bugkiller.* TO &#39;bugkilleruser&#39;@&#39;localhost&#39; WITH GRANT OPTION;</code></pre>
<p>Please note that you can’t link the root user to your Bugkiller
instance, as this causes SQL authentication errors.</p>
<h3 id="run-the-setup-script">Run the setup script</h3>
<p>The setup script is a page served in the <code>bugkiller</code>
folder to create and show a configuration file for Bugkiller. To find
out where it is on the web, run:</p>
<pre><code>echo &quot;http://$(ip addr | grep &#39;state UP&#39; -A2 | tail -n1 | awk &#39; {print $2}&#39; | cut -f1 -d&#39;/&#39;)/bugkiller/setup.php&quot;</code></pre>
<p>An example output would be:</p>
<pre><code>http://123.45.67.89/bugkiller/setup.php</code></pre>
<p>If you get a “website is unreachable” error, access the page using a
client to your server. For example, if your hosting server is a Chrome
device (Chromebook, Chromebit, or Chromebase), you can access the setup
program through the system’s Chrome (the local Crostini server is in
most cases assigned to the <code>penguin.linux.test</code> domain on the
<code>.test</code> special-use TLD - for custom containers, directly use
the IP address).</p>
<p>Enter the details of the server. This includes info about your
database, the name of the project that is using Bugkiller, and if you
want to allow Wikitext in bug descriptions. Bugkiller will process this
info and show the text of the configuration file, generated using a
highly accurate algorithm.</p>
<p>You can then copy the configuration file to a new
<code>config.ini</code> file in your Bugkiller installation
directory.<br />
When you save <code>config.ini</code>, you can then start accessing the
bug tracker by changing <code>setup.php</code> in the URL to
<code>index.php</code>, which will show the home page.</p>
