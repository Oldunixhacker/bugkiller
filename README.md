Bugkiller is a PHP script that allows you to manage bug reports for your
project. It uses a MySQL database.

## Features

* Allows your project's contributors to report bugs.
* Lets administrators block and monitor users (in the future).
* Uses accounts (in the future).

## Install

Bugkiller supports the LAMP stack with PHP.
Check the [Bugkiller Wiki](https://github.com/TylerMS887/bugkiller/wiki)
for installation steps.

## Why Bugkiller?

Bugzilla is dead. Phabricator is (kinda) dead. GitHub Issues is alive but is only
available for GitHub.
