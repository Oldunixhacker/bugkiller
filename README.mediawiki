__NOTOC__

Bugkiller is a PHP script that allows you to manage bug reports for your
project. It uses a MySQL database.

==Features==

* Allows your project's contributors to report bugs.
* Lets administrators block and monitor users (in the future).
* Uses accounts (in the future).

==Install==

Bugkiller is AMPware, meaning it supports most <nowiki>*</nowiki>AMP stacks.
Check the [https://github.com/TylerMS887/bugkiller/wiki Bugkiller Wiki]
for installation steps.

WAMP software is untested.

==Why Bugkiller?==

I haven't found any free alternative to discontinued bug trackers.
GitHub Issues is alive but is only available for GitHub.
You can only install Phorge to a whole domain.

So I wrote this to replace other bug tracking systems.
