{{configure.php}}
Bugkiller is a PHP script that allows you to manage bug reports for your
project. It uses a MySQL database.

==Features==

* OoUI-like interface, so that it fits perfectly with MediaWiki wiki farms and hosting services.
* Allows your project's contributors to report bugs.
* Lets administrators block and monitor users (in the future).
* Uses accounts (in the future).

==Install==

Bugkiller is AMPware, meaning it supports most <nowiki>*</nowiki>AMP stacks.
Check the [https://github.com/TylerMS887/bugkiller/wiki Bugkiller Wiki]
for installation steps.

WAMP software is untested.

==Why Bugkiller?==

Bug tracker graveyard is very large and filled with bug trackers.
GitHub Issues is alive but is only available for GitHub.
You can only install Phorge to a whole domain.

So I wrote this to replace other bug tracking systems.
